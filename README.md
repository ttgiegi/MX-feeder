# MX-feeder
This is a pick-and-place machine feeder project compatible with OpenPnP. The design goal is to achieve an extremely low profile and enable low-cost manufacturing for integration into pick-and-place systems.


Instruction:
The rotating shaft of the trigger buckle is an M2 copper pillar, whose length can be found in the mechanical parts. The screw used for this copper pillar is M2×4, while all other parts use M2×5 screws. The gear pins are installed on the PCB via interference fit, and their lengths are also indicated in the assembly diagram. The printed parts use M2 hot-melt nuts with a height of 4mm and a diameter of 3.5mm. To prevent the gear from wearing the PCB, spacers are fixed on the PCB with glue. For the sensor part, a 0603 optoelectronic receiver or emitter is mounted on the back of the circuit board, and a plug-in transmitter or receiver sensor on the other side forms a through-beam photoelectric sensor. Most other installation methods can be directly observed from the assembly diagram, so they will not be described in detail here.
